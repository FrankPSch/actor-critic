# Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning

This project tries to provide a clearer implementation of the A2C and ACKTR algorithms by OpenAI.   
  
Based on the paper by Wu, Mansimov, Liao, Grosse, and Ba (2017): https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.05144.pdf  
Original implementation: https://github.com/openai/baselines  

## Usage

### Examples

To train an Atari model run the following (see [a2c_acktr.py](actorcritic/examples/atari/a2c_acktr.py) for further details):  

    $ python -m actorcritic.examples.atari.a2c_acktr
